**mastorss** dumps RSS feeds into a mastodon account.
It is hacked together and generally only extended/fixed when it fails.
Do NOT assume it follows any standards.
Use at your own risk.

# Usage

Put `watchwords.json` into `~/.config/mastorss/`. Launch with profile name.
The first occurence of every watchword in an RSS item will be turned into a hashtag.
For profile-specific watchwords see the example in `watchwords.json`.
In the first run only the newest entry is tooted.

The profile can't be named "global".
